## Lessons Learned

I had many errors in my JavaScript that I did not see when I first designed this project. I learned the value of testing the application and making sure it responded to the values/event callers properly. I was missing an image and color for one of the signs, and a few of my < and > operators were backwards. Reviewing this project a few weeks later has served as a great example of the importance of reviewing your work and pacing yourself as you write.
